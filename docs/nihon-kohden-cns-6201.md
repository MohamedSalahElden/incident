# Nihon Kohden CNS-6201 Central Monitor Vulnerability

## Overview
A critical vulnerability in the Nihon Kohden CNS-6201 central monitoring system allows remote attackers to crash the system through malformed UDP packets, resulting in loss of patient monitoring capabilities.

## Technical Specifications

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2025-59668 |
| **Vulnerability Type** | NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476) |
| **Attack Vector** | Network-based (UDP) |
| **Authentication** | None required |
| **CVSS Score** | High (Availability Impact) |

## Affected Versions
- CNS-6201 software versions: 01-03, 01-04, 01-05, 01-06, 02-10, 02-11, and 02-40

## Attack Scenario
1. Attacker gains network access to medical device network
2. Sends malformed UDP packet to CNS-6201's open UDP port
3. Device attempts to dereference NULL pointer
4. Software crashes, causing monitoring system unavailability
5. Manual restart/reboot required to restore functionality

## Impact Assessment

=== "Availability"
    * Central monitoring service crash
    * Temporary system unavailability
    * Requires manual intervention to restore

=== "Patient Safety"
    * Loss of real-time patient data visualization
    * Interruption of alarm systems
    * Potential monitoring gaps during downtime

=== "Operations"
    * Manual restart procedures required
    * Operational workflow disruption
    * Need for backup monitoring protocols

## Mitigation Strategies

### :material-network: Network Controls
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate CNS-6201 on secure medical network
- **Access Control**: Restrict UDP communication to trusted devices only
- **Firewall Rules**: Block malformed or unexpected UDP packets

### :material-security-network: Security Measures
- **Intrusion Detection**: Deploy IDS to monitor for attack patterns
- **Traffic Filtering**: Implement deep packet inspection for UDP traffic
- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of medical device communications

### :material-update: System Management
- **Upgrade Path**: Migrate to supported models (CNS-9601, CNS-9101)
- **Incident Response**: Implement automated restart procedures
- **Alarm Escalation**: Verify backup alarm systems during downtime
