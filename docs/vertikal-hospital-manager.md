**Information Disclosure**{.cve-chip}
**Healthcare Systems**{.cve-chip}
**CISA Advisory**{.cve-chip}

---

## Description

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued advisory **ICSMA-25-301-01** warning of vulnerabilities in Vertikal Systems Hospital Manager backend services, a platform widely used by hospitals for operational management.

The vulnerabilities could expose sensitive system information, internal service paths, or configuration data that could assist threat actors in planning attacks or compromising connected hospital systems.

## Technical Details

### Component
**Vertikal Systems Hospital Manager** backend APIs / web services

### Vulnerability Type
Information disclosure through exposed error messages, internal paths, and potential misconfigurations

### Potential Weaknesses
- **Improper access control** or authentication on certain endpoints
- **Verbose error logging** that reveals system structure or credentials
- **Unrestricted API responses** leaking sensitive data

### Known CWE References
- **CWE-209**: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
- **CWE-497**: Exposure of System Data

## Attack Scenario

### Initial Access
An attacker (external or already in the hospital's IT network) could query exposed backend endpoints or trigger intentional faults to harvest detailed information about:

### Information Gathering
- **Application stack details** (framework versions, file paths, API routes)
- **Authentication tokens** or session IDs
- **Server or database configurations**

### Exploitation Chain
This intelligence could then be used to craft more targeted attacks:
- **Exploiting unpatched modules**
- **Pivoting laterally** within the hospital network
- **Preparing ransomware deployment**

## Impact

### Data Exposure
- Possible disclosure of **sensitive operational** or **patient data**

### Reconnaissance
- Adversaries could **map hospital IT infrastructure** and prepare future intrusions

### Operational Risk
- Potential **manipulation or unauthorized access** to hospital management functions if combined with other exploits

### Reputational Damage
- **Breach of trust** in healthcare data management systems

## Mitigations

### Immediate Actions
- **Apply all available security updates** from Vertikal Systems immediately
- **Restrict internet access** to backend interfaces; use VPNs with multi-factor authentication
- **Disable detailed debug/error output** in production environments

### Network Security
- **Segment networks** — isolate hospital management systems from patient devices and administrative networks
- **Enforce principle of least privilege** for users accessing backend systems
- **Use HTTPS / TLS** for all communications and ensure API tokens are rotated frequently

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Monitor and log abnormal API requests**, review intrusion detection alerts
- **Keep firmware and software components updated** across all ICS and medical subsystems
