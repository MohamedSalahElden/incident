# ASKI Energy ALS-Mini-S8 and ALS-Mini-S4 Vulnerability

**CVE-2025-62579**{.cve-chip}
**Code execution**{.cve-chip}
**configuration compromise**{.cve-chip}

## Overview
A critical security vulnerability in the embedded web server of ASKI Energy ALS-Mini-S4 and ALS-Mini-S8 IP controllers allows remote attackers to access and modify configuration parameters without authentication. The flaw provides full administrative control over affected devices, compromising their operational integrity.

## Technical Specifications

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2025-9574 |
| **Vulnerability Type** | Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306) |
| **Attack Vector** | Network (remote over IP) |
| **Authentication** | None required |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **User Interaction** | Not required |

## Affected Products
- **ALS-Mini-S4 IP** and **ALS-Mini-S8 IP** controllers
- **Serial Numbers**: 2000–5166
- **Firmware Versions**: All versions affected
- **Status**: End-of-Life (EoL) since 2022

## Attack Scenario
1. Attacker connects to the same network as the ALS-Mini device
2. Accesses the embedded web interface without credentials
3. Sends HTTP requests to configuration endpoints
4. Reads or modifies device settings remotely
5. Takes full administrative control of the controller

### Potential Access Points
- Direct network access to device IP
- Internet exposure if web server is publicly accessible
- SCADA/industrial network infiltration

## Impact Assessment

=== "Integrity"
    * Full compromise of device configuration
    * Unauthorized modification of load control logic
    * Alteration of thresholds and communication parameters
    * Potential disabling of critical alarms

=== "Confidentiality"
    * Access to sensitive operational data
    * Exposure of energy management parameters
    * Visibility into industrial control settings
    * Network topology reconnaissance

=== "Availability"
    * Operational disruption through misconfiguration
    * Load imbalance and system downtime
    * Energy management failures
    * Service interruption potential

=== "Network Security"
    * Entry point for deeper SCADA network attacks
    * Lateral movement opportunities
    * Industrial network compromise risk
    * Critical infrastructure exposure

## Mitigation Strategies

### :material-network-off: Network Isolation
- **Internet Exposure**: Never expose affected devices to the Internet
- **Firewall Protection**: Place devices behind firewalls with strict rules
- **IP Whitelisting**: Limit network access to trusted, whitelisted IPs only
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate from critical SCADA networks

### :material-security-network: Access Controls
- **Secure Proxy**: Use authenticated proxy for remote configuration needs
- **VPN Access**: Require VPN for any remote management
- **Physical Security**: Disconnect Ethernet if web server unused
- **Local Operation**: Device functions locally without network connectivity

### :material-monitor-dashboard: Monitoring & Detection
- **IDS/IPS Deployment**: Monitor network access patterns
- **Unauthorized Access Alerts**: Alert on suspicious connection attempts
- **Traffic Analysis**: Log and analyze HTTP requests to devices
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor for configuration changes

### :material-update: Long-term Solutions
- **Migration Planning**: Replace with newer, supported ABB/ASKI models
- **Asset Inventory**: Identify all affected devices in environment
- **Lifecycle Management**: Plan end-of-life device replacement
- **Vendor Support**: Engage with ABB for migration assistance

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Asset Discovery**: Locate all ALS-Mini-S4/S8 devices in network
2. **Network Assessment**: Verify current exposure and access controls
3. **Emergency Isolation**: Disconnect Internet-facing devices immediately
4. **Access Review**: Audit who currently has network access to devices

### Short-term Measures
1. **Firewall Rules**: Implement strict ingress/egress filtering
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy network monitoring for device access
3. **Documentation**: Document all devices and their network configurations
4. **Incident Response**: Prepare procedures for potential compromise

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Replacement Planning**: Budget and plan for device upgrades
2. **Security Architecture**: Design secure industrial network topology
3. **Vendor Engagement**: Work with ABB on migration timeline
4. **Training**: Educate staff on secure industrial device management

!!! danger "Critical Warning"
    These devices are end-of-life (EoL) since 2022. No security patches will be released. Immediate network isolation and migration planning are essential.

!!! tip "Emergency Response"
    If you suspect a device has been compromised:
    1. Immediately isolate the device from the network
    2. Check device logs for unauthorized configuration changes
    3. Review network logs for suspicious access patterns
    4. Reset device configuration to known-good state
    5. Implement additional monitoring before reconnecting
