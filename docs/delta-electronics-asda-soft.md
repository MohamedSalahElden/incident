# Delta Electronics ASDA-Soft Vulnerability

## Overview
Opening a specially crafted ASDA-Soft project file can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing data to be written outside the intended stack buffer. The issue exists in ASDA-Soft versions 7.0.2.0 and prior.

## Technical Specifications

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **CVE ID** | CVE-2025-62579 |
| **Vulnerability Type** | Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) |
| **Attack Vector** | Local / Adjacent |
| **Authentication** | None (requires user interaction) |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **User Interaction** | Required (opening malicious file) |

## Affected Products
- **ASDA-Soft (Windows)** versions 7.0.2.0 and earlier
- **Platform**: Windows-based engineering workstations
- **Trigger**: Opening maliciously crafted project files
- **Fixed Version**: ASDA-Soft v7.1.1.0 or newer

## Attack Scenario
1. Attacker creates a maliciously crafted ASDA-Soft project file
2. File is delivered to target via email, USB, or file share
3. Operator/engineer opens the project file in ASDA-Soft
4. Malicious fields in the file overflow stack buffer during parsing
5. Application crashes or enables arbitrary code execution
6. Attacker gains control in the context of the user

### Delivery Methods
- **Email Attachments**: Disguised as legitimate project files
- **USB/Removable Media**: Physical delivery to target systems
- **File Shares**: Placed on shared network drives
- **Social Engineering**: Impersonating trusted sources

## Impact Assessment

=== "Confidentiality"
    * **High Risk**: Attacker may read local files
    * Configuration data exfiltration possible
    * Access to servo drive parameters and settings
    * Potential exposure of industrial control logic

=== "Integrity"
    * **High Risk**: Modification of project/config files
    * Alteration of servo parameters if code execution achieved
    * Corruption of drive configurations
    * Potential for malicious parameter injection

=== "Availability"
    * **High Risk**: Application crash disrupts operations
    * Host compromise can halt configuration activities
    * Commissioning process interruption
    * Extended operational disruption if changes reach drives

=== "Prerequisites"
    * User interaction required (opening malicious file)
    * Local execution on machine running ASDA-Soft
    * Not directly remotely exploitable over network
    * Requires access to engineering workstation

## Mitigation Strategies

### :material-update: Software Updates
- **Primary Defense**: Upgrade to ASDA-Soft v7.1.1.0 or newer
- **Patch Validation**: Test updated version in development environment
- **Update Management**: Implement systematic update deployment
- **Version Control**: Maintain inventory of ASDA-Soft installations

### :material-account-check: User Security Practices
- **File Hygiene**: Never open untrusted project files
- **Source Verification**: Validate file origins before opening
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report unsolicited attachments immediately
- **Training**: Educate engineers on social engineering tactics

### :material-network-off: Network Security
- **Network Isolation**: Keep control/engineering PCs off public networks
- **Corporate Separation**: Isolate from corporate internet access
- **Air Gap**: Consider air-gapped networks for critical systems
- **Secure File Transfer**: Use controlled methods for file exchange

### :material-shield-check: Endpoint Protection
- **Antivirus/EDR**: Deploy up-to-date endpoint protection
- **Application Whitelisting**: Restrict unauthorized software execution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious file operations
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detect anomalous application behavior

### :material-account-lock: Access Controls
- **Least Privilege**: Run ASDA-Soft under limited user accounts
- **Admin Rights**: Avoid administrative privileges where possible
- **User Account Control**: Enable UAC on Windows systems
- **Role-based Access**: Implement proper user role segregation

### :material-file-check: File Validation
- **Quarantine System**: Scan files on isolated system first
- **File Integrity**: Validate project file checksums
- **Sandbox Testing**: Test suspicious files in controlled environment
- **Content Inspection**: Use security tools to analyze file structure

### :material-backup-restore: Backup & Recovery
- **Configuration Backup**: Regular backup of drive configurations
- **Test Environment**: Validate changes in non-production systems
- **Rollback Procedures**: Prepare quick recovery methods
- **Change Management**: Document all parameter modifications

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify all ASDA-Soft installations
2. **Version Inventory**: Document current software versions
3. **Update Planning**: Schedule upgrade to v7.1.1.0 or newer
4. **User Notification**: Alert engineers about file handling risks

### Short-term Measures
1. **Endpoint Hardening**: Deploy additional security controls
2. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate engineering workstations
3. **File Handling Procedures**: Implement secure file exchange protocols
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy logging and alerting for suspicious activity

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Security Architecture**: Design secure engineering environment
2. **Incident Response**: Prepare procedures for potential compromise
3. **Security Training**: Regular education on industrial cybersecurity
4. **Vendor Coordination**: Maintain communication with Delta Electronics

## Development Environment Security

### Secure Configuration Practices
- **Project File Management**: Implement version control for project files
- **Access Logging**: Monitor who accesses/modifies project files
- **Change Approval**: Require approval for production deployments
- **Testing Protocols**: Validate all changes in test environment

### Production Deployment
- **Staged Rollout**: Deploy changes incrementally
- **Rollback Testing**: Verify ability to revert changes quickly
- **Parameter Validation**: Confirm servo settings before deployment
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all configuration changes
