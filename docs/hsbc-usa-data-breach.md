## Description

On October 28, 2025, cybercriminals posted data on underground forums, alleging that HSBC USA customer and transaction records had been compromised. Data samples appear to include sensitive personal and financial details. The bank investigated and publicly denied that any breach occurred, but independent researchers and Cybernews staff found strong indications that the leaked data is authentic.

## Technical Details

### Breach Characteristics
- **Type**: Data exfiltration and public leak, no confirmed ransomware or system encryption
- **Alleged Source**: Cybercriminals claim the database was acquired via a "coordinated effort"
- **Bank Response**: HSBC USA denies being breached, saying internal investigations found no evidence of system or provider compromise

### Compromised Data Fields
- **Personal Information**: Full names, addresses, SSNs, birthdates, phone numbers, emails
- **Financial Data**: Transaction histories, stock orders, bank account numbers

### Data Verification
- **Analysis**: Cybernews and external researchers analyzed samples
- **Authenticity**: Dates indicate records are weeks old
- **Target Profile**: Probably belonging to corporate/institutional clients, since HSBC USA exited retail banking in 2025

## Attack Scenario

### Attack Progression
1. **Initial Access**: Attackers obtain HSBC USA data via unknown means, possibly:
   - Third-party provider compromise
   - Credential-based access

2. **Data Exposure**: Data uploaded as proof-of-breach to data-leak forums

3. **Criminal Distribution**: Attackers offer dataset for trade/sale to other criminal actors

4. **Secondary Exploitation**: Personal details, bank accounts, and transaction history enable follow-on threats:
   - Identity theft
   - Spearphishing campaigns
   - Account fraud
   - Targeted scams

5. **Infrastructure Status**: No evidence of direct system intrusion or ransomware activity on HSBC USA's operational infrastructure
